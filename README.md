# Medical Insurance Cost Prediction (Mini Project)

## Objective
To predict medical insurance charges based on customer information using Machine Learning.

## Dataset
Medical Insurance Dataset with the following features:
- Age
- Sex
- BMI
- Number of children
- Smoking status
- Region
- Charges (target variable)

## Methodology
1. Data Cleaning and Encoding
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Training and Comparison
5. Overfitting Analysis (Train vs Test)
6. Model Deployment using Streamlit

## Models Compared
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- KNN
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)

## Best Model
- **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**
- Test R² Score ≈ **0.83**
- Lowest RMSE among all models

## Evaluation Metrics
- RMSE
- R² Score
- Train vs Test comparison to detect overfitting

## Deployment
The best model is deployed using a Streamlit web application that predicts insurance cost in real time.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit
- GitHub
